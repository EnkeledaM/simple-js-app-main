# Pokédex – Exercise 1.5 (JavaScript DOM Manipulation)

This project is part of the **CareerFoundry Software Engineering Course**.

---

## 🎯 Goal of this Exercise

The goal of **Exercise 1.5** is to build on the previous exercises (1.3 and 1.4) and use **DOM manipulation** to display Pokémon data directly in the **browser interface**, rather than in the console.

---

## 🧩 What’s new in this version

✅ Pokémon now appear as styled cards in the browser (using the DOM).  
✅ Added CSS styling for a clean, modern Pokédex layout.  
✅ Conditional message “Wow, that’s big!” is displayed for the tallest Pokémon.  
✅ Color coding based on Pokémon type (grass, fire, water, rock).  
✅ Removed `document.write()` and `console.log()` — replaced with `createElement()` and `appendChild()`.
